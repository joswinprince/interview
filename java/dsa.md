## Data structures
> A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.
It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program.

> There are many different types of data structures, each designed to store data in a way that suits a specific purpose. For example, a list is a data structure that can store a collection of items in a linear order, while a tree is a data structure that can store a collection of items in a hierarchical order.

#### Benifits
* They can help to improve the **performance** of your software programs.
* They can help to make your software programs more **reusable**.
* They can help to make your software programs more **maintainable**.
* They can help to make your software programs more **scalable**.

### Arrays
> An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory.

#### Advantage
* They are easy to use and implement.
* They are efficient in terms of both space and time.
* They can be used to store a variety of data.
* They can be used to implement a variety of data structures.
