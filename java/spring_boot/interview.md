## Interview

1. What is Spring Boot, and how does it differ from the Spring framework?
   > Spring boot is  a java based open source framework used to build production grade stand alone spring based application. It provides a streamlined way to setup and develop spring application by offering a convention over configuration approach.
spring boot is built on top of spring framework and offers several advantages over traditional spring applications.
- Simplified configuration
- Embedded server
- Standalone application
- Opinionated Defaults
- production ready features
- Integrated Development Experience:

2. Features:?
- Embedded servlet container
- Auto configuration: automatically configures based on the dependencies present in class path.
- spring boot actuator: provides a built in production ready feature for monitoring and managing applications.
- Test support: unit testing, integration testing , end to end testing.
- Spring Boot Starter: Spring Boot provides a collection of starter dependencies that simplify the setup of various components and frameworks (e.g., Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security). Starter dependencies include all the necessary dependencies and configuration to get started with a specific feature or technology.

3. Spring mvc ?
> Spring MVC simplifies the development of web applications in Java by providing a robust and flexible framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. It follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three main components:
- Model: Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
- View: Renders the user interface based on the data provided by the model.
- Controller: Controller acts as intermediary between model and view, handling user input and update the model accordingly.
